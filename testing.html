								<h2>Personality Test</h2>
								<p>In high school, consuls are typically the cheerleaders, setting the tone, taking the spotlight and leading their teams forward to victory and fame. Later in life, consuls continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy. This would help influence my team as I would try to make sure everyone is happy and knows what they have to do. Additionally, if anyone had any problems, I would try my best to resolve them.</p>
								<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
								<p>I've always considered myself to be a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and I tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. I need to be active and take frequent breaks and often speak with my hands and with gestures. This would be beneficial in a team as I will always have visuals prepared to help other members understand key concepts as well.</p>
								<h2>Creativity Test</h2>
								<p>This test stated that I have the ability to make connections between things that don't initially have an apparent connection. This would my team and I as I am able to see things that others may not be able to easily identify, but I should consider finding a creative team as I may not be able to contribute a lot of creativity.</p>
