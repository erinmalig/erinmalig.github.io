								<h2>BusEasy</h2>
								<p>Whilst searching online for an easy printable bus timetable for the week, I noticed the difficulty in a very simple task. This encouraged me to come up with the idea of Bus Easy. A free website and application that enables you to put in your buses number which generates the timetable in an easy to view format.</p>
								<p>It difficult to think that this hasn't been created in a simplier way compared to the way that we currently view it, which is on the PTV website. This application would be very helpful to people who aren't tech savy and may find it difficult to find this important information as PTV does not give you acccess to easy to read printable bus timetables.</p>
								<h2>VetA</h2>
								<p>Vet A or how some may pronounce it, VETA, is a simple to use website / application that can enable the user to book easy vet appointments online. Asking the user for information relating to their quiry, the user is able to upload photos of their pet to help the vet understand the problem prior to arrival.</p>
								<p>This will not only help speed up vet appointments but help to save animals lives. By looking at these photos vets may be able to identify the urgency of the case and provide immediete attention over the phone or ask the customer to come in sooner. This application has the potential to save people's money as there can be an online vet appointment that can be made for less urgent cases. This would be a minimalised cost made by the veterinary clinic and will be cheaper than an in vet consultation.</p>
								<h2>FoodGram</h2>
								<p>Is an 'Instgram like' application that lets users post photos on their profiles of food that is pleasing to the eye. You will be able to discover new places to eat as you scroll on the discovery page and follow new people. This encourages people to expand their horizens and find out about new places around them or in other countries that they may have not known exists.  </p>
								<h2>Downloadify</h2>
								<p>An extremely useful applciation that allows the user to install a program on any device such as a computer, phone or tablet that monitors downloads on another device. Have you ever been sitting at your computer waiting for a long download to be complete whilst wanting to go do something else? This application sends you an email or text message saying that the specific download has been complete on your other device.</p>
							    <p>This allows users to do other things with their time whilst they are waiting for a movie to download or for a software update to be complete. This increases an individuals efficiency and ability to get more things done during the day, instead of hanging around waiting for important updates or downloads to be complete.</p>
								<h2>IG Planner</h2>
								<p>This application allows users to post photos before actually uploading them to their main instagram accounts. By letting the user preview their post before posting, they are able to see if the image matches their Instagram theme. Some hardcore Instagram users are obsessed with the way their Instagram profiles look, so this application would help especially these type of people.</p>
