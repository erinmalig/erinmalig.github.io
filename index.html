											<h2>Introduction</h2>

									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Why IT</h3>
										<p>I've always been that 'go-to' person within my family and friends when it comes to troubleshooting. My extensive knowledge in IT guided me to choose this course and further my passion and career for the future.</p>
										<p>Specifically, I have a strong interest in physical technology such as tablets, phones and computers. I am always the first to get the latest tech as I love to be able to experience and see the new features introduced every year, first hand. This is one of the reasons I chose to study IT as I can learn about different types of technology and potentially create new products.</p>
										
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Occupation</h3>
										<p>After working at McDonalds for almost 3 years, I was able to gain the experience needed that led me to begin a new chapter, gaining a part-time job at Vodafone. I have been employed here for less than a month now and I love working with the latest technology and creating contracts everyday.</p>
										<p>I am hoping to gain a job in the near future in the Apple retail store, where I can start to get myself familiar with the employers and prepare myself for my ideal job. My extensive knowledge on Apples products would be able to help me in the future with my career working with Apple. Additionally, through trial and error I have learn't a lot about the way Apple products work and how the OS functions.
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
										<h3>Animals</h3>
										<p>Although I love IT, animals will always have a special place in my heart. For almost all my life I wanted to be a vet but I decided that the best option for me was to gain a career in IT. To be able to incorporate IT and still work with animals would be a dream of mine. 
										<p>I have a 5 year old dog named Kobe and I recently surprised my family by bringing home a new kitten name Kylo who is less than 6 months old.</p>
